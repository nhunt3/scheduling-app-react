Scheduling App

Made per specs (with no data persistence). React only (no redux, node, or mongo)

There are only 3 files the really do stuff and are not boilerplate:
App.css
App.js
EditModal.js

To get this to run, do the following:
1. open terminal
2. cd to directory you want to clone repo to
3. run "git clone https://github.com/nhunt3/scheduling-app-react.git"
4. run "npm install"
5. run "npm start"

You should be good to go. Let me know if that's not the case.
